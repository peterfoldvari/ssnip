## ssnip: hypothetical monopoly test

# Description

SSNIP stands for the *Small but Significant, Non-transitory Increase in Price* method to find a set of goods that constitute a market. It is often used to asses the impact of mergers and acquisitions.

*ssnip* tests for a predefined subset of k goods, sel_ssnip tests for al possible combination of all k goods.

*sel_ssnip* returns a matrix, with rows sorted in an increasing order of the *critalpha* value. *critalpha* is an estmate of the maximum price increase that a hypothetical monopolist could introduce and still have a profit increase. That is, *critalpha* indirectly measures the possible market power of the monopoly. It is advisable to choose the smallest subset of goods, where *critalpha* exceeds the predefined limit set by the researcher.

This code is based on a 2002 online manuscript and a 2003 published paper by Ian M. Dobbs (Professor (Emeritus) of Business Economics and Finance, Newcastle University Business School)

# Usage 

  ssnip(P,Q,M,elast,z,R)

sel_ssnip(P,Q,M,elast,z)

# Arguments

P:	kx1 column vector of unit price

Q:	kx1 column vector of quantity sold

M:	kx1 column vector of the percentage markup of price above marginal cost (Lerner Index)

elast: kxk matrix of price elasticites

z:	scalar, the assumed increase in price (eg: 0.05 stand for 5%)

R:	kx1 vector of restrictions selecting a subset of goods

# Values
*D_0*:	Change of profit after an infinitesimaly small price increase.
*D_profit_z*:	Change of profit after zx100% increase in prices
*critalpha*: The maximum rate of change of prices that results in an increase in profit (eg: 1.05 stand for 105%)

 ##Define the input vectors and matrix
 P <- c(1.5,1,1.2)
 Q <- c(18,20,5)
 M <- c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6)
 elast <- cbind(c(-3,1,1.1),c(1.1,-4,2.1),c(0.9,0.9,-1.5))
 z <- 0.05

 ##Testing for the 1st and 2nd goods:
 R <- c(1,1,0)
 ssnip(P, Q,M,elast,z,R)

 ##Testing for alll possible combinations:
 sel_ssnip(P, Q,M,elast,z)
